Zeripath's Cinnamon Window List

This applet is a modified version of the original window-list but with features
for controlling maximized windows.

* Clicking on the Window List Button for a focused Maximized window will
  Unmaximize it. Clicking once again will Minimize it.

* Clicking on the Window List Button for a Minimized window will Restore the
  window, clicking once again will Minimize it.

* Double-clicking on the Window List Button for a Maximized window will
  Minimize the window.

* Double-clicking on the Window List Button for a Minimized or Unmaximized
  window will Maximize the window.

These features are very helpful if you wish to turn off titlebars for maximized
windows and have a flipped menu bar. I use this with the cinnamon window
buttons applet and a modified theme which removes the titlebars.
